# Rick-and-Morty-Almanac

This is a responsive web application created from scratch on the famous TV series Rick and Morty 

 This website stores information about all the characters belonging to this TV series, the locations, species and the variety of kinds of people.
 
 All the information has been displayed in a categorized manner for user-friendly experience 
 
 I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and React Js and published it on Github 

 The project has been hosted on Netlify and the link to the website is  https://rick-morty-almanac.netlify.app/
